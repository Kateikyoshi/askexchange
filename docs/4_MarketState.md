There aren't many Q&A websites on the market, especially the ones targeting programming.
Websites like Baeldung, geeksforgeeks, javapoint etc. aren't considered Q&A websites, so won't be analysed.

Pure Q&A website dedicated to programming only is StackOverflow and there aren't any other like it.
StackOverflow Annual Revenue is $50.0M - $75.0M and Total Visits are 247.4M according to [similarweb.com](https://www.similarweb.com/website/stackoverflow.com/)

Popular Q&A rival with questions regarding every topic, including programming, is Quora.
Although it is more general and hence less effective.
Quora Annual Revenue is $25.0M - $50.0M and Total Visits are 777.8M according to [similarweb.com](https://www.similarweb.com/website/quora.com/)

Just for comparison there is an old website Code Ranch with little activity.
It is not a Q&A format and works as a forum. Either way its
Annual Revenue is $5.0M - $10.0M and Total Visits is 571.6K [similarweb.com](https://www.similarweb.com/website/coderanch.com/#overview)

From that information it can be concluded that there aren't many competitors on the market, but they are
quite formidable.
